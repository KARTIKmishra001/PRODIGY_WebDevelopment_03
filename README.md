🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A beautifully designed and responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project offers an engaging and interactive experience with both 2-Player and AI modes, featuring smart AI logic, smooth animations, and a clean, modern user interface.

🧩 Features

Two Game Modes: Play against another player or challenge an intelligent AI opponent.

Smart AI Logic: The AI uses simple strategy-based moves — blocking, winning, and taking optimal positions.

Real-Time Game Updates: Displays current turn, winner, or draw results dynamically.

Scoreboard: Tracks wins, draws, and player scores for ongoing matches.

Beautiful UI: Gradient background, glowing effects, and animated winning cells.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Reset & Mode Switch: Instantly restart the game or switch between modes anytime.

🧠 How It Works

The game is built around a grid-based board of 9 cells. Each player alternately clicks on a cell to mark it with X or O. The script checks for a win or draw after each move using pre-defined winning combinations. In AI mode, the system calculates the best move for the computer using simple pattern recognition and randomization.
